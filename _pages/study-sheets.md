If you’re studying for an advanced level certification, it can be daunting to try and keep up with all of the content in the official blueprints to determine where your stronger and weaker points of knowledge lay. The following study sheets are a freely available resource designed to help you track progress as you work towards your certification goal.

## VMware

* VMware Certified Advanced Professional (VCAP)
  * Data Center Virtualization (VCAP-DCV)
    * Deployment
      * [VCAP6-DCV Deploy: Blueprint 3V0-623 study sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mT9KUCofckekTIAQC6_PCqkO9J4yGcbU_NO__SzTUSI/edit?usp=sharing)

## Instructions

Each study sheet is broken down by section and objective. Next to each objective are four boxes:

1. **Read** – The objective has been researched and related material has been read over.
1. **Lab** – The goal of the objective has been reproduced in a lab environment.
1. **CLI** – Used to denote when an objective has been completed or researched for the CLI command, when applicable.
1. **GUI** – Used to denote when an objective has been completed or researched for the GUI, when applicable.

Chris Wahl has created a brief video that demonstrates the Study Sheet in a bit more detail. As always, please make sure to let him know if the video was helpful with a **Like** or **Share**, and support his video efforts with your [Subscription](https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=wahlnetwork)!
