My name is Troy Lindsay, and this is my personal blog about virtualization, automation, & cloud computing, and in no way represents the opinions of my employer.

I am currently a Cloud Architect at [Armor](https://www.armor.com/), an active cyber-security company, and enjoy spending most of my days designing products, infrastructure, and tooling with my fantastic team for our [Armor Complete](https://www.armor.com/armor-complete-secure-hosting/) (secure public cloud) and [Armor Anywhere](https://www.armor.com/armor-anywhere-security/) (security as a service) product lines.

I was inducted into the [VMware vExpert program](https://vexpert.vmware.com/directory/2112) in March 2018!

I am also an active member of the [Dallas / Fort Worth VMware Users Group (DFW VMUG)](https://community.vmug.com/communities/localcommunityhome?CommunityKey=728ccc0f-3171-43e8-8cbc-64119afb8c90) and Dallas / Fort Worth vBrisket Meat Up Group, so come say hello at the next event.

My old blog can be found [here](https://troylindsayblog.wordpress.com/).
