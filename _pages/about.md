## Author

Hi!  My name is Troy Lindsay, and I am currently a Partner Solutions Architect at [Amazon Web Services][AWS] on the [VMware Cloud on AWS][AWS_VMC] Core team.  I enjoy spending most of my days designing features, infrastructure, and tooling with my fantastic team as well as with my awesome counterparts at VMware. <br>[Check it out][VMC_AWS]!

Prior to AWS, I was a Principal Cloud Architect at Armor, an active cyber-security company, where I helped design the Armor Complete (secure public cloud) and Armor Anywhere (security as a service) product lines.
